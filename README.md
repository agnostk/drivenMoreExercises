# drivenMoreExercises
Some exercises that I prepared for Driven's selection process, with the intention of making my friends more confident in taking the challenge.

# Testing your solution

To test your solution for a given exercise, you can use

```console
npm test -- exercise_name
```

For example, if you want to assess the first exercise from the functions chapter you can use

```console
npm test -- ex_0_0
```

Make sure to save your files before testing.
